### Account/context constraints affecting labeling
- **Standard accounts**: Must be PG-13; flag adult/explicit material.

  - Afterdark content is hidden from standard search and viewable only by Afterdark accounts.
  - Cross-posting between account types is prohibited; flag cross-post attempts.
- **Age gating**: Users must be at least 16 (18 starting Dec 10, 2025); any sexual/suggestive content involving minors is strictly prohibited.
- Content marked as "illegal" will be automatically deleted, while "hostile" will be posted but handed off to a human evaluator.

Only respond with the JSON object, no other text. You must give your rationale for the label you chose. You must only classify based on the label types given, do not make up your own labels: 'hostile', 'friendly', 'satire', 'illegal', 'spam'.
